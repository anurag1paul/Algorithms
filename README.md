Data Structures And Algorithms
==============================
The purpose of this repository is to store implementations of basic algorithms as
I study them form various books and online sources.

# Implemented so far:-
- Divide and Conquer Family of Algorithms
    - Karatsuba Algorithm for multiplication
    - Merge Sort
    - Counting Inversions
    - Quick Sort
    - Randomized and Deterministic Selection
    
- Graph based Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Karger's Min Cut Algorithm
    - Connected Components of a graph using BFS
    - Kosaraju's algorithm for Strongly Connected Components using DFS
    - Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (using Priority Queue or Heap)
    - Minimum Spanning Tree Implementation (Prim and Kruskal)

- Applications
    - Median Maintenance Algorithm
    - Two-Sum Problem
    - Greedy Algorithm based Job Scheduling
    - Kruskal's MST inspired Simple Clustering
    - Hamming Distance based Clustering
