Data Structures And Algorithms
==============================
The purpose of this repository is to store implementations of basic algorithms as
I study them form various books and online sources.

# Implemented so far:-
- Divide and Conquer Family of Algorithms
    - Karatsuba Algorithm for multiplication
    - Merge Sort
    - Counting Inversions
    - Quick Sort
    - Randomized and Deterministic Selection
    
- Graph based Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Minimum Spanning Tree Implementation
    - Karger's Min Cut Algorithm
    - Breadth First Search
    - Kosaraju's algorithm for Strongly Connected Components
    - Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (using Priority Queue or Heap)

- Heap Application
    - Median Maintenance Algorithm
